# PredicateStructure

A description of this package.

## TODO

- Remove PS as an enum to be just a structure
- Create a real SPS structure, and not just a type alias
- See the nomenclature of function names. E.g.: notSPS -> not (should be better with the new SPS structure, no more ambiguity)
- Generalise for not only a couple for set for a PS, but also a MFDD.
